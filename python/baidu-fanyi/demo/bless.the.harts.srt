105
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,910
要是我們拍個自己的廣告呢
Well, what if we made our own commercial,

106
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,170
展示綠點最愛的海鮮餐廳里
showing all the-the sweet down-home faces

107
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,080
甜美簡樸的人
at Greenpoint's favorite seafood restaurant,

108
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,920
菜單來源于露易絲的家族食譜
where the menu comes straight out of Louise's family recipes

109
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,830
和60年的傳統
and-and 60 years of tradition!

110
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,010
如果我們拍廣告  我們可以向那些企業混蛋展示
If we did a commercial, we could show those corporate butts

111
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,090
我們本地的南方魅力
our homegrown southern charm!

112
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,670
真是個好主意  珍妮
That's a great idea, Jenny.

113
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,890
拍廣告是個復雜的工作
Directing a commercial's a big job.

114
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,440
你需要一個對餐廳  食物
You need somebody who knows the restaurant, the food,

115
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,560
以及人民了如指掌的人
the people like the back of her hand.

116
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,610
但最重要的是你需要一個
But mostly you need someone

117
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,560
沒有穿著睡衣在城里閑逛的人
who's not wandering around town in her pajamas.

118
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,330
珍妮可以做到
Yeah, Jenny can do it!

119
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,530
什么  不不
What?! Oh, no, no.

120
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,950
我們應該雇用一個專業人士
We should definitely hire a professional for this.

121
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,290
綠點雇用不起專業人士
Greenpoint can't afford a professional.

122
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,490
嚴格來說我們現在甚至沒有警力
We technically don't even have a police force right now.

123
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,540
我們仰仗公民的逮捕
We rely on citizen's arrests.

124
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,710
-什么  -當我沒說
- Oh, what? - Never mind, forget I said that.

125
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,090
但是現在還有足夠的備用現金
But there is just enough money left in the till

126
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,800
支持你拍廣告
for you to make the commercial.

127
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,550
我不是賭徒  但我建議我們
I'm not a gambling man, but I say we put
